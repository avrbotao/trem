#	it is more of a collection of ideas, plans, reminders,
#	and even thoughts that may give a glimpse of what is yet to come,
#	although not in an orderly manner...

########	reeng as per cmpt 

---	must not cmp dirs

---	flags to 'ls -lrtd' and 'diff'

***	detect and reflect EMPTY DIRS on 'prune' (to rmdir) ...

***	build file operations lib (libfops) : copy / compare / del / rename

***	ditto for directory (libdops) : mkdir / rmdir / rename

***	cache created dirs : avoid multiple 'mkdir -p samedir'

flag (-?) on default 'weigh' .. cmp instead of cp 
	- then (-?) touch -r ... newer > older

improve cmd quoting & escaping
