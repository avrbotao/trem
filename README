	Readme

This is the `README' file for 

	What is it ?


	Tarball

it is distributed in a tar-gzipped archive, and to open it, simply :

$ gzip -d 
$ tar xf 

	Source-code directory

After the steps above, go to the source-code directory, 

$ cd ...

	Installation

Building could hardly be simpler; just unpack it, and in the source directory :

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

- and you're done, gnu-style.

	Validation

Optionally, you can

$ make test

right after `make' (or at any later time),
just to validate some key features and functions.

	Concepts


	Reports


	Development

this is an ongoing project,
so the 'TODO' file has quite a few tasks, plans, ideas
still to be implemented in due time.

	Warnings


	Feedback

Bug reports should be directed to the `support' facility at SourceForge;
However, any comment, improvement/enhencement suggestions, problem report,
or general feedback can be sent by email and is very welcome.

In the case of bug/problem report, please include specific details about
the operating system, compiler, processor architecture, and version number.

	Notes

(1) Using ANY software with `root' privileges requires appropriate knowledge.
